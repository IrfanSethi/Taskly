# Taskly

## Introduction
Taskly is a modern, user-friendly task management application built with Python and Tkinter (using ttkbootstrap for styling). It is designed to help users efficiently organize, prioritize, and track their daily tasks in a visually appealing way.

## Overview
Taskly provides a simple interface for adding, viewing, and managing tasks. Each task can be assigned a due date, time, duration, and priority. The application stores tasks persistently in a text file, allowing users to keep their data between sessions. Taskly is ideal for students and anyone looking to improve their productivity and time management skills.

## Features
- Add tasks with name, due date, time, duration, and priority
- View all tasks in a sortable, color-coded table
- Mark tasks as completed (with visual feedback)
- Delete tasks
- Persistent storage: tasks are saved and loaded from a text file
- Color-coded priorities: High (red), Medium (orange), Low (green), Completed (white)
- Theme selector: switch between light, dark, and pitch dark modes
- Simple, clean, and responsive interface

## Future Steps
- Add support for recurring tasks
- Implement notifications or reminders for upcoming tasks
- Add calendar or timeline views for better visualization
- Enable task editing and bulk actions
- Sync tasks with cloud storage or mobile devices
- Improve data storage (e.g., use JSON or a database)

## Why This Project?
As a high school student aspiring to enter university, I created Taskly to demonstrate my interest in software development, user experience, and productivity tools. This project showcases my ability to:
- Design and implement a complete application from scratch
- Use Python and GUI frameworks effectively
- Apply good coding practices and user interface design
- Solve real-world problems for students and busy individuals

Taskly is both a personal productivity tool and a portfolio project to highlight my skills and passion for technology. I hope it helps others stay organized and motivated, just as it has helped me!
